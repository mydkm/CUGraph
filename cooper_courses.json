Although the principles of heat and mass transfer have widespread usage in the chemical process industry, these principles are also applied in food science, pharmaceutical, and other industries. First, we will begin by learning the three principle modes and mechanisms of heat transfer. After developing a strong understanding of how heat and energy are transported, we will consider mass transfer as an analogous transport process by which matter is transported by diffusion. We will then consider how both energy and mass are transported by convective motion and apply the analogies and relationships between convective momentum, heat, and mass transfer. Throughout the course, we will use multiphysics simulation software to help us enhance our transport phenomena learning experience. Lastly, we will apply all of these principles to the design of heat transfer equipment, particularly heat exchangers. To accomplish this, we will learn process simulation software to aid us in heat exchanger design.",

The focus is on convex optimization, which is the solution of problems with only one best cost, design, size etc. We will consider problems such as least squares, supply chain management, batch process networks, network flow, dynamic programming, portfolio optimization and other examples across all engineering disciplines. Students will learn about optimization theory and problem formulation, with some computational component. By the end of the course, students should be able to: create optimization problems from a physical situation, identify whether the problem can be solved or not, transform problems into equivalent forms, list optimality conditions for problems, find the dual of a problem and identify its relation to the primal,and use at least one method to solve a convex programming problem using a computer.

We often interact with these systems without giving them much thought. At the same time, many components of these systems are aging and outdated, no longer meeting the needs of the communities they serve. One major challenge in maintaining these systems is identifying damages and prioritizing maintenance and repairs. Crowd sourcing is a data collection method that relies on public citizens to provide data and is a powerful tool in collecting real-time information about urban and environmental conditions. In this class, we will discuss the power of crowdsourcing data to better understand and maintain NYC infrastructures.

    "description": "How do emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality meet digital fabrication tools like 3D printers? And how might these tools be used to create immersive experiences and meaningful artifacts that tell an individual's story? In this class, students will learn novel and traditional technologies in The Cooper Union’s Makerspace to prototype solutions for the needs of communities in rural and urban settings. Students will be introduced to interactive app development and create 3D assets for virtual and physical environments by completing a series of design challenges in teams. Throughout the course they will develop an iterative making practice by rapid prototyping their ideas starting with cardboard & paper and progressing to 3D modelling & worldbuilding. By engaging in research activities that pull from human-centered design and systems thinking, they will gain the critical thinking skills to see the “target users” of their projects as people with real needs and question the effectiveness of technology as a way to answer them. Students will learn: • Computer aided design for 3D printing, lasercutting, and digital assets, • Augmented and Virtual Reality development software, • Human-centered design.

    "title": "Redesigning Plastics Recycling",
    "description": "Many types of plastics are used in everyday life and recycling them in a practical and sustainable way is challenging for consumers and the plastics industry. This class will focus on the plastic known as PLA, which is used in the rapidly growing 3-D printing industry. PLA is derived from plant starches and is more eco-friendly than most other plastics; however, it is a type 7 plastic and as such it is rarely recycled and often ends up in landfills. There, the plastic endures for hundreds of years before decomposing, despite often being advertised as ‘biodegradable’. In this class, students will apply engineering methods to improve PLA recycling by designing and performing experiments and interpreting results in order to advance the field of plastics recycling and make 3D printing more sustainable.
