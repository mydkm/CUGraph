Although the principles of heat and mass transfer have widespread usage in the chemical process industry, these principles are also applied in food science, pharmaceutical, and other industries. First, we will begin by learning the three principle modes and mechanisms of heat transfer. After developing a strong understanding of how heat and energy are transported, we will consider mass transfer as an analogous transport process by which matter is transported by diffusion. We will then consider how both energy and mass are transported by convective motion and apply the analogies and relationships between convective momentum, heat, and mass transfer. Throughout the course, we will use multiphysics simulation software to help us enhance our transport phenomena learning experience. Lastly, we will apply all of these principles to the design of heat transfer equipment, particularly heat exchangers. To accomplish this, we will learn process simulation software to aid us in heat exchanger design.",

For each class meeting, students read current scientific and technical literature and come prepared to discuss current events related to technological innovation. Each student researches potential disruptive technologies and prepares a compelling argument of why the specific technologies are disruptive so they can defend their choice and rationale. In addition to technological innovation, students will investigate organizational culture and structure and how these enable an innovation ecosystem at the corporate, regional, and global levels. Students will interact with national level innovators throughout academia, industry, and government. Coursework includes extensive writing assignments.",

Students will learn about optimization theory and problem formulation, with some computational component. By the end of the course, students should be able to: create optimization problems from a physical situation, identify whether the problem can be solved or not, transform problems into equivalent forms, list optimality conditions for problems, find the dual of a problem and identify its relation to the primal,and use at least one method to solve a convex programming problem using a computer.

Introduction to visualization techniques used to reveal and capture details of these flows, leading to the application of these techniques to actual flows in the lab or in the field. Essential photographic methodology for still images and movies, including lighting, exposure, depth of field and digital image post-processing. Use of tracers, including dyes, vapor, bubbles and particles as well as optical tools, such as schlieren and/or shadowgraph. Natural and engineering flows will be examined, beginning with mathematical and physical analysis of visualizable properties, including buoyancy, interfaces, vorticity, streamlines and pathlines, and concluding with an actual image or movie. Motivated by the immense scientific and engineering importance of flow visualization in vehicle design, dispersal of environmental pollutants, biomedical flows and many others, flow images are an important form of technical communication and will be critiqued and improved, culminating in a final project exhibition.

In very different eras, two major public health crises - the AIDS epidemic, and the COVID-19 pandemic - have challenged how we relate to our own bodies, and dance has been uniquely situated to address these challenges as it works to conceive and shape the body. Some themes the course will engage include: How did the AIDS crisis cause American society to confront its understanding of sexuality (among other things), and what role did dance play in this confrontation? How has COVID highlighted existing societal inequities along racial and class lines, and how has a cultural practice like dance - that often depends on many people gathering together, and requires many financial resources - both reflected these inequities, as well as offered possibilities for change? Finally, given the ongoing nature of COVID, what can our study of the AIDS crisis teach us about the current moment, in dance and in society? In examining the intersection of dance and these public health crises, this course will consider how sexuality, race, and class converge on the body, and use methods particularly developed by and through dance scholarship to analyze these essential issues with a multifaceted and interdisciplinary approach. Finally, we will ask what dance can do as we navigate through the lasting effects of the current pandemic.",

The essence of science, in fact, lies in the desire for searching, leading to a necessarily provisional knowledge which survives as a paradigm until it is eventually contradicted by new investigations. Moreover, it is important to acquire consciousness of the political, economic, and cultural constraints acting on both the methodology and the goals of contemporary science. Nowadays these constraints cannot be ignored, but few are really prepared to reflect free from political or philosophical bias.",

At the other end of the globe, what does the vast and forbidding Antarctic continent have to tell us? What are the polar regions to us now, in times of re-escalating political tensions and rising temperatures? To give shape to these questions we will look at literary works inspired by the planet's extreme regions (for example, Mary Shelley, Coleridge, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne and other nineteenth-century authors as well as contemporary writers), histories of famous explorations (for example, Shackleton's voyage to Antarctica), and recent scholarship on climate change and polar history. Along the way we will look at questions of conflict between the technologies of developed nations and indigenous peoples' habits of sustainability; the geopolitics of research stations; art activism; documentary filmmaking; polar tourism; and the fate of polar species in an environment whose climate is rapidly shifting. In short, the course is an advanced introduction -- no prerequisites other than the HSS core sequence -- to an interdisciplinary subject that touches upon history, science, technology, politics, literature, and art.",

    "prereqText": "",
    "description": "Stephen Greenblatt’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2011 book, The Swerve: How the World Became Modern , has inspired a resurgence of interest in the Roman philosopher, Lucretius, and his magnum opus, De Rerum Natura (“On the Nature of Things”). On the Nature of Things is the most ambitious philosophical poem ever written (what a delightful way to get your philosophy!) and the single best source for our knowledge of ancient Epicurean philosophy and the theory of atomism which was its most essential feature. But De Rerum is also an exquisitely beautiful work of poetic art and a gold mine of information and ideas on subjects as wide-ranging as mythology, religion, morality, science, sex, cosmology, geology, history, horticulture, agriculture, meteorology, astronomy, humanism, sociology, the senses, pleasure, and life in the late Roman Republic (1st century BCE). Join me in a close-reading and exploration of one of the most sublime works of philosophy ever penned. There is really nothing like it in the centuries-long global history of thinking about the origins of the universe, its nature, and the reasons for its existence. Engineers, artists, and architects will all find something of interest. For engineers, there is plenty of science, a surprising amount of which still has currency. For artists, there is an endless wealth of memorable images which have inspired creative minds for centuries. For architects, there is cosmic theory and reflections on space and time. And for everyone, there is Lucretius' incomparable poetry. As an added bonus, by chance, this very old text also happens to offer singular relevance for the present world moment: De Rerum ends with a dramatic extended description of a plague and its societal repercussions. The course lends itself particularly well to remote learning. It will be conducted seminar-style, featuring in-class readings and discussions of the six books of De Rerum Natura (in translation) along with selected excerpts from additional primary texts which either influenced or were influenced by Lucretius' work. Students will be expected (1) to participate fully in, and on two occasions to lead class discussions, (2) to keep a running journal, and (3) to produce one short response paper and a final 8-10 page term paper on a question that emerges from their journal.",

For the Pythagoreans, in effect, those we now consider as separate disciplines were inseparable aspects of a unique inquiry, inspired by a mystical enthusiasm and carried out through a profound philosophical and mathematical search. In Pythagoreanism, then, sifted through Platonic philosophy, we may find the first historical antecedent of many of the components which contributed to the birth of the modern world. The course starts from such premises and explores the meaning and the implications of the mysticism of number in Pythagoreanism, with particular emphasis on its influence on mathematics, art, and philosophy.

Such an ideology would be at the root of European colonialism and North American neo-imperialism, and at the same time of the concealing of the distinct and peculiar identity of the cultures of the Global South. According to this critical view, then, an authentic critique of modernity can only come from the liberation movements of the periphery. From there an awakening of a true ethical consciousness can come, thus reconstructing modernity’s project of human emancipation as a liberation from exploitation. Not in vain, in the cultural debate from which the philosophy of liberation originated there were a series of social and political movements focused on the liberation from the historical, political, and cultural domination that derived from Western modernity and neoliberal rationalism.",

Infrastructures mediate our needs and desires, facilitate work and play, divide private from public space, determine what we can or cannot access, and connect our everyday actions to planetary systems and other lives across the globe. Looking at these underlying structures and technological arrangements points to the very root of philosophical inquiry, challenging us to question the things we take for granted. This course explores infrastructure as a way of seeing and framing philosophical questions about the built environment, capitalist growth, inequality, and climate change. We will critically investigate theorical approaches to and ordinary assumptions behind various physical and digital infrastructures as well as a broader range of things we might conceive as infrastructural, such as social programs, zoning, and urban ecologies. Course readings will explore public works and city planning; water systems and climate resilience; electrical grids, fossil fuels, and renewable energy; supply chain logistics and waste; and automation, surveillance, and cloud computing, among other topics. We will ask: What is infrastructure and what is its place in our cultural imagination? How have conceptions of it changed over time? What values and norms are embodied in infrastructural design and technologies? Can infrastructure be socially just or unjust? How does infrastructure constrain or open possibilities for different climate futures and alternative ways of living together? What happens when it breaks down? 3 credits.",

What rhetorical or narrative methods are used to express gendered realities where acts of writing do not always equate with authority, truth, or stability?

The couple—as a form, aspiration, mandate, and obstacle—has occupied writers, artists, filmmakers, and social scientists for centuries. Shaping discursive and institutional frameworks at the level of the body, the household, and the state, the couple continues to be one of the most tenacious, if contested and ever-changing, forms of loving and living. In cinema, the couple has been a central figure for narrative experiments in companionship, complicity, and enmity: the forbidden love in Douglas Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows (1955); the partners-in- crime in Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967); the neighbor-lovers of a waterlogged Taiwan in Tsai Ming-liang’s The Hole (1998); the paranoid, self-isolating lovers in William Friedkin’s Bug (2006) etc. The course combines weekly film screenings with readings in literature, gender studies, film theory, anthropology, psychoanalysis, and philosophy, we will, first, identify and analyze the potentialities and limits of the couple form, and, second, develop analytical tools needed to understand and elucidate film form.

    "description": "The modern period of philosophy in the Anglo-European world, dating from the 17th through the early 20th century, begins with radical investigations into theories of knowledge and the human mind. Epistemological questions—including where ideas come from, how cognition relates to senses and to the body, the basis for truth and scientific understanding of nature, and how we gain self-knowledge and knowledge of others—are established as the foundation of what it means to be \"\"modern” in a normative sense. Posing these foundational inquiries also begins to link social power to human knowledge as opposed to religious authority, and thus to the potential to apply knowledge in reshaping the earth, transforming society, and establishing forms of subjectivity rooted in the power of reason. This course will introduce major philosophical works in this Western philosophical tradition starting from the early modern period through various debates within and revolts against the European Enlightenment. We will focus on texts by philosophers such as René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Particular focus will also be given to ways of historicizing and countering the dominance of modern epistemology and science in relation to critical, contemporary, and global perspectives.",

We will examine the various systems of colonial and imperial power, past and ongoing, and their lasting impact in various ways across the region.

The seminar may be repeated for credit with the permission of the dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. 3 credits. Machine Philosophy [HUM 373-M] ( Spring 2024 ) In this course we will investigate the functional utility of the concept of the machine. How has it been invoked historically in relationship to the concept of the human? What anxieties about—and desires for—humanness has it served to name? In particular, we will consider how the alienness of the machine has been embraced by Asian and Afrofuturisms in order to critique and reimagine both radicalized imaginaries of otherness and the concept of the human itself. We will also ask whether or not there are distinct qualities of machinic cognition that have transfigured the materiality of our planet and, if so, how? In other words, we will consider the machine as both reflecting the irresolution over what is distinctly human and as itself a mode of cognition that is alien to human consciousness. Some of the authors we will be consulting in our study are Gilbert Simondon, Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari, CCRU, Anne Anlin Cheng, Luciana Parisi, N. Katherine Hayles, Denise Ferreira da Silva, Mel Y. Chen, Kodwo Eshun, and Jasbir Puar. Virgil's Rome [HUM 373-N] ( Spring 2024) In the opening line of her recent biography of the Roman poet, Virgil, Sarah Ruden speaks of “the tenderness and majesty” of Virgil’s poetry ( Vergil. The Poet’s Life , Yale University Press, 2023). (Ruden is in a position to know, since she has translated the Aeneid herself, and is the first to render the epic in metrical English.) Ruden’s formulation perfectly encapsulates the distinctive character and universal appeal of a poetic voice that has, as the cliché goes, been imitated and emulated but never equaled over the many centuries since the poet’s death in 19 BCE. For nearly two millennia, Virgil reigned virtually unchallenged as the supreme poet not just of classical antiquity, but of all time, at least in the west. During the Christian era, this “pagan” poet was not just admitted into the fold, he was fervently embraced, on the basis of having predicted the birth of Christ in one of his early works, or so it was believed. He is Dante’s guide through Hell and Purgatory in The Divine Comedy . For centuries (yes, centuries!) his works were consulted for advice or predictions of the future in a process called the sortes Vergilianae (“Virgilian lots”) [google it]. This seminar explores the poetic output of Publius Vergilius Maro (to use his full Roman name), in the context of the Augustan era in which he lived and wrote. Augustan Rome presents the only serious (ancient) contender for comparison with the “Golden age” of Periclean Athens. In all categories of art, architecture, and literature, the age of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (27 BCE-14 CE), rivals that of high classical Greece. The singular era Augustus shaped still resonates in our modern global world. Virgil’s poetry continually reflects and refracts the pressing issues of the day, political, social, and cultural. In a close reading of all three of Virgil’s extant works, the Eclogues , the Georgics , and the Aeneid , we shall focus on the historical content in particular, thereby allowing a picture of Augustan Rome to emerge, as seen through the eyes of its greatest poet.",

    "prereqText": "",
    "description": "The course focuses on the great Roman poet Ovid’s magnum opus, the epic Metamorphoses, an entertaining, witty, and erudite compendium of endlessly fascinating stories about the Greek gods and heroes--their loves and their hatreds, their power and their foibles, their benevolence and their brutality, their crimes and their punishments--and many other topics of interest that arise and are pursued peripherally by the poet as the long trajectory of his narrative unfolds. Composed in dactylic hexameter, the meter of Homer, in the late first century BCE, the twilight of Augustan Rome, the intensely visual Metamorphoses has reigned unchallenged as the primary source of Greek (and Roman) mythology for all of the arts in the Western tradition and beyond. Its famous stories continue to be adapted and interpreted in multiple media well into our own day. The stories that Ovid chooses to tell, which constitute a rather idiosyncratic curation of the vast corpus of Greek myth loosely strung together in a complex, continuous narrative, have just one feature in common: they all conclude with some form of transformation. While Ovid will guide the direction of our syllabus, our reading of the Metamorphoses will be supplemented by additional literary, historical, and mythographical primary source materials, whether inspiring Ovid or influenced by him.",

How does this “subversive science,” as it’s sometimes called, challenge human-centered traditions of knowledge and dominant views of nature? In our time of planetary crisis, ecology asks us to think about the world in complex and relational ways, pointing to the radical possibilities of kinship with other species and care for the web of life that sustains us. Our course will begin by tracing ecological thinking from Linnaeus and Darwin to the foundational 20th century research that helped define ecology as a science, with the rise of plant succession studies, systems ecology, and energetics. Along the way, we will explore a multidisciplinary range of texts that help us to consider the implications of key ecological concepts and debates for critical perspectives on built and cultivated environments; class, race, and gender; and capitalist production, land use, and colonialism. Looking at ecological relationships that span from our surroundings in New York City to other complex systems around the world, we will discuss questions drawn from eco-philosophical movements and fields such as environmental justice, deep ecology, ecofeminism, anthropology of science, and political ecology. We will ask: How does foregrounding the interconnections between things modify our understanding of social and natural categories? What role does imagination play in scientific methods and cultural representations of science? How might ecology help us rethink economy, design, and infrastructure? How does it shape our commitments to human and non-human others in the face of climate change, habitat loss, and mass extinction? What would it mean to live within the regenerative capacity of our ecosphere? 3 credits.",

Countering these tendencies with imaginative possibilities requires not only literacy in climate science, but an ability to draw new constellations of ethical, political-economic, and cultural meanings from across divergent mitigation and adaptation pathways. This course asks how to collectively imagine alternative climate futures by bringing together multidisciplinary perspectives on economic growth and its dominant historical and temporal meanings. We will look critically to various philosophical debates, ethical theories, and cultural materials that shed light on the present climate crisis and place it within interrelated contexts of ecology and the biosphere, global capitalism and colonialism, sustainability and “just” transitions, contested narratives of the Anthropocene, eco-apartheid and forced human migration, geoengineering and technology, and social and environmental justice.",

We enlist it in our everyday lives as well in considering how we orient ourselves with others and how we arrange structures or features of our environment But recent events, most notably, the Corona Virus Pandemic and what has ensued over the past few years as we emerge from “crisis” has shined a light on this hidden dimension of social and structural life and made us reconsider how it has been engaged, and, going forward, how we need to refashion it so as to sustain things we want—keeping and making social connections-- and also reduce or avoid things and people we don’t -- isolation and exclusion. The crisis affords opportunities if we choose. We are moving on, but where? This course will consider the area of proxemics as already understood and then consider how we can employ design and behavior as a way of creating local and global connections going forward. We will look at how various parts of society are already refashioning design and behavior using social behavior, technology, and art to address places we interact in, e.g., work, health care, retail, schools, public spaces, public transit. Underlying issues reflecting social inequities and other problems that persist or have been intensified will also be explored. Social distancing heightens awareness of things previously considered inconsequential or perhaps ‘natural’. The current crises helps/makes us see/makes visible what and who was not viewed as essential or important and recasts them as such. We will ask: What is essential? Who is essential? Who are we individually and collectively and how can we reflect these in design and in our interactions? We will be utilizing a sociological frame, but also enlist resources from other disciplines and cultures as well—e.g., technology, architecture, landscaping, art, environmental design to offer policy and practice.",

The seminar may be repeated for credit with the permission of the dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. 3 credits. Histories of Race in Latin(x) America [SS 318-N] ( Spring 2024 ) This course studies the histories and cultural genealogies of race and racialization in Latin America and in the Hispanic/Latinx community in the United States. Racial hierarchies helped shape asymmetrical power relations in colonial societies and postcolonial states in the Americas. However, racial and ethnic identities also informed forms of indigenous, Black, and anti-colonial resistance. Against a backdrop of discrimination and emancipatory hopes, depictions of race and racial mixing have been prominent in representations of the Latin American identity and in national ideologies of the region’s modern states. This course traces continuities and changes in colonial and modern discourses about race from Mesoamerica, the Caribbean, and South America. We will also relate these discourses to contemporary discussions about race and ethnicity in the U.S. Hispanic/Latinx community. Throughout the semester, we will study primary texts (legal documents, chronicles, essays, census records, speeches, paintings, and photographs) and selected historiographical essays. Anthropology of Belief [ SS 318-O] ( Spring 2024) Why do we believe what we believe? How do we know what we \"know\" is true? What is \"human nature\"? Anthropology of Belief explores fundamental concepts in anthropology that historically attempt to understand the behavior, traits, and patterns of human groups globally and how belief both structures and guides cultures. This course, which covers a wide variety of cultural groups across the world, grapples with these deeper questions. We examine, analyze, and discuss ethnographic texts across the subfield of sociocultural anthropology, beginning with the early work of anthropologists working under Franz Boas in New York City at the beginning of the 20th Century and continuing to contemporary work. We also look at the qualitative and immersive methodological aspects of anthropology. We think together with anthropologists, using the frameworks of social constructionism, cultural relativism, racial/ethnic analysis, conflict/warfare, kinship/descent, ritual/religion, the formation of political/economic societies, class/hierarchy, and gender/sexuality, while familiarizing ourselves with the discipline's fraught historical context.",

Racial hierarchies helped shape asymmetrical power relations in colonial societies and postcolonial states in the Americas. However, racial and ethnic identities also informed forms of indigenous, Black, and anti-colonial resistance. Against a backdrop of discrimination and emancipatory hopes, depictions of race and racial mixing have been prominent in representations of the Latin American identity and in national ideologies of the region’s modern states. This course traces continuities and changes in colonial and modern discourses about race from Mesoamerica, the Caribbean, South America, and the U.S. Latinx community. We will discuss such topics as the production of indigeneity, colonial taxonomies for racial mixing, race and gender in post-colonial Latin America, AfroLatinidad, and “Mestizaje” and the Latinx Identity.",

Students will be invited to critique the colonial heritage of spatial aesthetics in the West, placed in opposition to various immigrant experiences, considering immigration and immigrant groups in their varied historical, socio-economic, and political contexts. Students will take on individual research projects around specific New York City immigrant groups, beginning with the group’s context and ultimately observing the group’s aesthetics as projected internally and externally. Through reading, discussion, and workshops, students will become immersed in a chosen immigrant group’s spaces in New York City and will use this knowledge to challenge majority spatial aesthetic norms. While ostensibly relevant to both art and architecture students, this course has much deeper appeal across the college regardless of discipline. We are living and studying in this city of immigrants, including Cooper students, many of whom are themselves first- or second- generation. The work raises personal cultural questions such as how one’s own immigrant group perhaps influenced her/his/their path of study, how different such groups value art, architecture, and engineering, if critical perspectives on imperialism can alter the perception of one’s own work, and so on – all this lending to a richer debate over cultural norms in the West.",

This is marginal analysis: a fundamental concept of decision making in economics. Economics is the study of decision making under scarcity, something that we all do daily because most of our resources are scarce. Thinking about the overall economy, we are the consumers, the suppliers of labor, and potentially the producers; therefore, our decisions affect the overall economy and the shocks that happen to the economy affect us as well. This course will introduce you to basic macro-and microeconomics concepts and help you think about how to use them understand the behavior of individuals, firms, and the government. with specific focus on current events.",

What political and economic ideas have informed subject positions of owner, owned, and dispossessed? How has the concept of the “possessive individual” affected the lives of Indigenous peoples, enslaved Africans, women, and workers? How have modern property relations and material possession been challenged by these groups, and what kinds of “re-possession” are possible in the face of dispossession? Together we will identify historical patterns of ownership and dispossession and Black, Indigenous, and feminist critiques of them through analyses of race, empire, gender, segregation, occupation, surveillance, and social reproduction. We then consider how communities have experienced, upheld, and contested property logics. This second half of the course encourages us to think capaciously about material, legal, and symbolic infrastructures that both (1) reenforce patterns of dispossession and (2) forge conditions for radical struggle within, against, and beyond dis possessive property regimes.",

The course is rooted in West Africa, but it places West Africa and West Africans at the center of dynamic global movements. We will study how Africa and Africans shaped many world orders, from Islam to the Atlantic World to the Third World. This course begins with the great West African empires and continuing through the eras of slave trades, the formation and consolidation of the Islamic and Atlantic worlds, and the end of colonization. We conclude with some post-colonial questions and debates with great bearing on independent Africa. Throughout the roughly 700 years this course spans, we will ask questions about long-term processes of change. How have states and state power changed over the course of the seven hundred years or so this course covers? Equally importantly, how have people’s relationships to states changed? How did Africans build new forms of power and authority? How did they resist others? How did different dividing lines—ethnic, gender, race, and class—change over time in African social, political, and cultural life?",

They are simply confusing correlation with causation, a common logical fallacy. Think about the following question: Does getting your master’s degree cause you to earn higher income? By how much would those two additional years in school increase your earnings? Most people would say, “Yes, of course.” Having a master's degree leads to a higher paying job. You can get data on various individuals, their educational attainments, and their earnings. You can examine the relationship between these two variables. But are you actually measuring the impact of having a master's degree on earnings? There are many other questions that you can try to think about in the same manner – questions related to individual decisions, business decisions, and government policies. In this course, we will learn how to think about these questions in a systematic way. The course will make you think critically about many claims that are being thrown at you by news reporters and even your professors. The course will also teach you how to work with various types of datasets to answer various questions in economics, psychology, business, politics, and sciences.

Among the areas singled out for special examination are the Bowery and the Lower East Side, Central Park and the \"downtown\" of amusement and vice, wherever it happened to be at the time.",

Students will handle documents dating back to the 1860s—materials richly intertwined with individuals and events in the wider world—and conduct in-depth investigations into their choice of topics and archival material. Though the primary material may be related directly to The Cooper Union, the questions students ask of it will lead towards broader social issues and movements. 3 credits.",

    "description": "In 1948, the newly-formed World Bank declared anyone with a per capita annual income below $100 as “poor,” and as if by fiat, over three-quarters of humanity became “impoverished” in an instant. But poverty has existed for centuries. The reason this declaration was remarkable was because this was the first time a global “minimum standard” for wealth had been established, which inevitably ranked nations on a scale ranging from less to more developed. This global problem of poverty called for new and innovative global solutions, and was the moment of the birth of \"International Development”—the idea that “developed” nations ought to have a vested interest in the reduction of global poverty and in the economic development of other nations. The reality of this global project, however, has been markedly different from this promise. International Development, supercharged by the Cold War, became a weapon for toppling regimes, making covert war, and cornering new markets. It propped up military dictatorships in Asia, Africa and Latin America, armed religious extremists in Central Asia and the Middle East, created oligarchies, and compelled poor, often newly-independent nations, to exploit their natural resources in order to benefit private global firms. Using readings drawn from history, economics, political science and development studies, this elective course looks at the history of the modern period when humanity has tried to fix the problem of poverty, to understand what has worked and what hasn’t, and why.",

Whether voluntary or forced, this migration changed not just the demographics of places around the world, but also profoundly transformed culture and the economics of labor. This migration took on many forms—from people seeking new work opportunities to those forced to move because of indenture, and from people fleeing wars and persecution to those seeking to reunite with separated families—and remains a contested topic in today’s world. We will read about South Asian merchants who moved to East Africa to become critical economic entrepreneurs, about formerly enslaved Africans who were sent to the Caribbean to perform indentured labor, and the migration of the Chinese to Singapore as a replacement for “lazy natives,” among other examples. And we will also focus on the ways in which the British Empire developed new tools and technologies of surveillance and permits—including the passport as we know it today—to control the movement of colonial subjects. The migration of various colonized people was a critical subplot in the story of Empire, and the course will highlight the ways in which these immigrants tried to overcome draconian colonial administrative states to build successful lives in foreign lands.",

Consciousness studies is a multidisciplinary field in science that includes approaches and methods from neuroscience and physics, philosophy and anthropology, artificial intelligence and linguistics. We will try to learn more about the contribution of all these sciences, all aimed at answering one question: \"What does it mean to have consciousness?\" Some representative questions we will be discussing are: What is the function of consciousness? How intelligent is the unconscious? What is the relationship between consciousness and attention? Can a machine ever be conscious? Is consciousness fundamental in the universe (as Eastern philosophies argue) or did it emerge as matter became ever more complex (as Western science insists)? Is there a stream of consciousness or is this just an illusion? What could happen if we didn't have consciousness? The course brings together modern and historical ideas to give a perspective on how the problem of consciousness could be addressed. Each topic presents a question that we will try to answer, each topic includes reading part, demonstration of effects and experiments and a small written review task.",

Through figures such as Randolph Bourne, John Dewey, Meyer Schapiro, Lewis Mumford, C. Wright Mills and Dorothy Day, we will trace the rise and fall of the American avant-garde, the quest for an indigenous theory of culture, the social sources of counterculture, and the shifting meanings of the concepts “mass culture,” “consumer culture,” “kitsch,” and highbrow/middlebrow/lowbrow. Among the questions we will address are: Can one be a political radical and a cultural conservative? A political conservative and a cultural radical? Fall 2022 American Radicalism: Theory & Praxis . This course will serve as a think tank and workshop. Together, we will ask a number of theoretical questions about historical periods understood as “American,” such as revolution, abolition, reconstruction, prohibition, and racial/gender/sexual integration. We will ask questions like: What is American radicalism? What do we mean when we say those terms together, one after the other? What directions does the phrase move in throughout the history of “America,” whatever that might be? If radicalism is a product of American social and political culture, which is a composition of European political philosophy, then what if we said radical Americanism? What does that mean? Is it different? By surveying “American” history’s cultural and political artifacts, we will mine them for critical information about so-called “radical” positions as they transit through time. Included in the course readings will be revolutionary pamphlets, prohibition propaganda slogans, abolition postcards, cultural and artistic performances alongside black studies texts from W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, Saidiya Hartman, Sylvia Wynter, Christina Sharpe, Omise’eke Tinsley, C. Riley Snorton, Hortense Spillers, and more. The hope of this course is to use these investigations to interface more critically with our own non-academic practices. The expectation is that we will bring the things that we think about outside of the classroom—our art and technical practices, social life, and more—to bear on what we will study together. What do these concepts have to do with what we already do? We will use the city as a laboratory for our study when we can. The classroom is our space and time to compare notes. Writing assignments in the course will respond to guided questions to ask throughout as we practice and think about our study outside of the classroom. Throughout the course, our most important question will be: How do we do differently in the wake of a study on American radicalism?",

    "description": "As a part of the ongoing discourse on the tripartite interrelation among art, religion and modernity, this class investigates \"Buddhist art,” the visual culture of one the world religions, rooted in the premodern societies of India, Central, South East and East Asia and Tibet, from which its distinctive material forms, visual principles and ritual practices developed. More recently, the presence of Asian Buddhist material/visual cultures has asserted itself anew through transnational exchanges and confrontations, particularly between Asia and the modern and contemporary West. This course attempts to historicize this phenomenon by taking a macro approach to Buddhist art (without sacrificing specifics related to individual cases) by investigating two possible constituents of modern/contemporary Buddhist art: its core historical principles carried over from its origins, which have been considered “timeless,” and its uniquely “timely” complication of or deviation from its original systems. We will spend half of the course studying some original principles of historical Buddhist art in areas such as visuality, representation, copy, agency, function and performativity, while quickly tracing the geo-historical spread of the religion throughout Asia over a period of more than 2,400 years. In this section, we will visit selected works and sites that represent some typologies of premodern Buddhist art, such as relics, icons, mandala, pagoda, gardens and “Zen art,” and examine them in “context,” i.e., concerning their relations to the ritualistic/symbolic practices and fundamental philosophy of the religion. The latter half of the class will explore the issue of collisions in modernity between two claims: an insistence on the immutability and authenticity of persistent premodern systems of Buddhist art and experimentations reflecting the ever changing globalizing identities of the religion and regions in Asia, corresponding to recent social, political and cultural landscapes, including museum displays, temple politics, Orientalizing commodification and appropriation by avant-garde artists.",

The result was the creation of a diverse, multicultural world, connected by shared elements such as the use of the Greek language, but in which every individual region and society was unique. This diversity is especially evident in the art produced in this period, where we see the Greek obsession with human form, preferably nude, mixing with older artistic traditions in Egypt and Mesopotamia that relied on hierarchy and repetition to perform their functions. In Italy the Romans adopted aspects of Greek art as a means of disrupting their rather stodgy political ideology, with mixed results, whereas in India Greek motifs, popular for reasons as yet unknown, were pressed into the service of Buddhism. We will focus especially on themes of interaction – how do old and new artistic traditions combine? – and identity – what did these combinations mean to the people who made and used them? – as well as on the roles of power and resistance.",

The first one, which unfolded from the 1920s to the 1940s in Brazil, Mexico and Cuba, witnessed the artists’ combination of imported European avant-garde tendencies—such as post-impressionism and Cubism—with local motifs to produce an art that could reflect a national identity. The second wave pertains to the post World War II rise of abstract tendencies in South America, specifically, concrete abstraction in Argentina and Brazil, and op and kinetic art in Venezuela. Artistic modernisms in the region will be studied in connection with the political and cultural context in Latin American countries, specifically, the process of nation-state building, the rise of populist ideologies, and the incidence of developmentalism in the Southern Cone during the 1950s and 1960s. We will analyze a range of artists, such as Tarsila do Amaral, Candido Portinari, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Frida Kahlo, Wifredo Lam, Mario Carreño, Pedro Figari, group MADÍ, Lygia Clark, Helio Oiticica, Carlos Cruz-Diez and Jesús Rafael Soto. Topics might include: the strategies of modernity in Latin America, the new concept of “inverted utopia,” the role of the avant-garde group manifestos, the post-colonial, and the meaning of abstraction within a turbulent political milieu. We discuss crucial concepts that define cultural modernism in Latin America — among them, identity, indigenismo, costumbrismo, transculturation, syncretism, hybridization, and race politics. 2 credits.",

By examining a diverse range of artworks from antique sculptures through Renaissance paintings, African memorial portrait masks, documentary photographs and films to early 21st century videos, we will address the development of portraiture as a genre, examine conventions of mimetic representation and discourses of identity formation. Artists to be discussed include, among many others, Chantal Akerman, Shirley Clarke, Jacques-Louis David, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Francisco de Goya, Frans Hals, Frida Kahlo, Joshua Reynolds, Malick Sidibé, Catherine Opie, Wolfgang Tillmans, James Van der Zee, and Andy Warhol.",

    "description": "Ceramics, or fired clay, in its intrinsically multifaceted and global nature, resists a straightforward categorization, such as “crafts.” It signifies a medium-defined genre of visual art, that of material culture as well as socio-political practices which have been prized around the world throughout human history. Due to the absence of a core mega-narrative and central theories, investigating ceramics across the globe can be flexible and exploratory, dealing with various identities and cross culturally-connected and disconnected diverse lineages within its world history. This course will experiment with one scenario of the world history of the medium by unpacking ceramics as thing (material, technologies and objects), value (symbols, identities, aesthetics and concepts) and ritual (display, performance, community and daily life) through time and space. The class will proceed in two parts: reviewing selected historical episodes telling stories of contacts and exchanges; and introducing some major critical discourses and issues over the multivalent status of ceramics in relation to modern/contemporary art and society. As a point of entry to history, our global, chronological mapping will start with East Asia, one of the hubs of world ceramic cultures, examining its prehistoric and later enshrinement of the medium, and moving through the Ages of Exploration, Empires and colonial/postcolonial periods in Europe, Africa, Middle East. We will then return to an Asia in contact and conflict with 20 th and 21 st century Euro-America, where some artists/designers exploring ceramics’ new potential as a distinctive material/medium have emerged as cultural celebrities.",

In doing so, it revisits the euro-centric humanist model of the Renaissance and seeks instead to offer a new paradigm based on an analysis of global exchange. Themes covered include art, empire and propaganda, colonial identities, hybridity, rituals of devotion and the translation of sacred space. In addition to an understanding of post-colonial theory, and the cultural mediation of images, the course considers hybrid objects in the words of Homi Bhabha as not having a single fixed meaning, but as incorporating “slippages,” that are part of the conditions of colonialism. It also offers up a critique of any analysis based on a simplistic framework of cultural parallelism, and seeks to present hybrids as having multiple and at times contradictory meanings evolving from cross-cultural exchange. In addition to lectures and readings, students will participate in one museum field trip. Attendance on this field trip is mandatory. Although the format of this class is a lecture, student participation in weekly discussions is encouraged and expected.",

This course also prioritizes performance art as one among many answers to the problem of embodiment and experiment. Together, we will explore key texts and performances within the field of performance studies to address the generative exchange between art and critical theory. Key words or sites include the relationship of speech to deed; discourse to materiality; inscription to violence; and embodiment to history.

Art historians have long focused their attention on the singular masterpiece and their attendant notions of enduring value, aesthetic perfection, and the ideal. Yet recent scholarship in fields such as media studies have demonstrated that the ephemeral and obsolescence or the outdated have played an equal role in our understanding of the work of art and its materials. What if a work of art was meant to last for just 15 minutes? What would it mean to make a work of art that lasted the span of a snapchat? We will explore the notion of the ephemeral through a series of readings organized around conceptual terms such as dust, the archive, the monumental, celebrity, and happenings. Theoretical readings and class discussions will be anchored in the study of works of art ranging from paintings, sculpture, decorative arts, film, and performance art, from antiquity to the present. These discussions will be supplemented by visits to museum collections and conservation labs at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library and Museum, and other institutions in the New York area. The aim of the course is to demonstrate that artworks are not only the object of an artist’s intentionality, but subject to changing cultural perceptions of time.",

    "description": "This course focuses on women and art; and intends to propose a reconstruction of some little known but major women’s contributions to art, to history, and/or to the women’s liberation movements. Organized by medium, as well as chronologically, this course proposes to identify major modes of expressions used by women historically (and until today), and discusses them in their cultural, technological, theoretical, and socio-historical contexts of origin (including feminisms). The course starts with deconstructing historical representations or misrepresentations of women in visual arts, and discusses them alongside the visibility of art by women artists or lack thereof in history. The recent efforts by the art market and institutions, lately including more women’s art in exhibitions and collections, will be discussed, and questioned. Because the artworks of individuals who self-identify as women are often found in non-traditional media for the fine arts, our case studies bring us to consider works in the form of: public speaking, publishing, poster-making, and other agit-prop such as: tee-shirts, buttons, stickers, etc., as well as performance art, public action, and video art. Then, because women artists often worked collectively and collaboratively, a special attention is given to works by collectives such as: New York Radical Women, Redstockings, Les Insoumuses, Salsa Soul Sisters, Guerrilla Girls, Grand Fury, WAC, and more recently: Black Lives Matter, #MeToo movements internationally. While learning about women in visual arts, we also discuss how their practice engages or not with trends identified as part of the development of feminism. Concepts such as “First Wave,” “Second Wave,” “Radical Feminism,” “Anti-Feminism,” “White Feminism,” “Black Feminism,” “Womanism,” “Post-Feminism,” and “Neo-Feminism” are also clarified and allow to approach the intersectionality of feminisms with race and BIPOC, as well as LGBTQ communities historically. Then the more recent discussions regarding non-binary gender identities are evaluated as a challenge as well as an opportunity for feminism.",

    "description": "This course focuses on conversations between queer art practices, queer studies of contemporary art, and queer theory. The term “queer” is mobilized to both rework the slur of shame and injury into a term of self-identification and non-normative political positioning, and also as a critical questioning of the norms and categories of sexual identity and practice (“queering”). Queer theory has direct import for the study of contemporary art, as many of its key concepts have been developed in and through the visual, and scholars have taken up issues of gender, sexuality, and sexed embodiment as central to the formation of art historical narratives and their exclusions. In turn, queer artists contribute to queer theory by appropriating and contesting conventional art practices, mediums, and histories in order to visualize and produce alternatives. Rather than presenting a genealogical history of queer art, this course explores key theoretical texts that have shaped contemporary queer art practices, and at the same time, how queer art practices operate as their own theoretical propositions and interventions. This course also focuses on how the political aims of queer art and theory are crucially shaped by intersections of critical race, postcolonial, transgender, class, and crip politics. Investigating visual practices of queering as they intersect with queer theories and studies of contemporary art, we explore critical concepts and visual tactics that include abstraction, archival interventions, camp, disidentification, ecologies, performativity, necropolitics, public feeling, and worldmaking.",

The seminar may be repeated for credit with the permission of the dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. 2 credits. Art of Colonial South Asia [HTA 313-L1] ( Spring 2024 ) This seminar aims to teach students how to look at, think about, and engage critically with the visual culture of British India. Together, we will examine the repercussions of the Anglo-Indian colonial encounter on the disciplines of painting, decorative arts, photography, and architecture. We shall not only study the objects themselves, but interrogate the cultural, political, and intellectual circumstances under which they were produced, circulated, collected, and displayed. Finally, we will explore the legacy of the British empire today—its influence on contemporary art, the politics and practices of museum displays, repatriation debates, and beyond. The course will involve visits to museums around the city. For the final project, students will conceptualize their own exhibitions, selecting eight artifacts that present a broad view of the art of colonial South Asia. Artists' Writing [HTA 313-M1] (Spring 2024) This course is an introduction to artists’ writing from the postwar period to today, either as an integral or a complementary part of their practice. In this course, artists’ writings will be discussed in relationship to the visual works. The content is roughly organized chronologically and according to various literary genres: biography, autobiography, homage, interview, poetry, fiction, auto-fiction, as well as opinion or position pieces and theoretical essays. An alphabetic indicative selection of authors discussed in this course includes Vito Acconci, Louise Bourgeois, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Liam Gillick, Philip Guston, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Allan Kaprow, Robert Morris, Yoko Ono, Nan June Paik, Lorraine O’Grady, Faith Ringgold, Martha Rosler, Carolee Schneemann, Hito Steyerl, KimSu Theiler, Lucia Vernarelli, as well as a number of artists’ Manifesti authored collectively. This selection particularly focuses on representing the significant but often underrepresented field of writings by women artists. As the assigned texts are in English, issues of translation as well as writing in English as a second language will be addressed; students are also encouraged to discuss writings in other languages than English for their assignments. In addition to studying artists’ texts, students will produce a significant amount of writing for this course (some of which will happen during class time) as well as be required to work closely with the Center for Writing and Learning. Performance and Property [HTA 313-N1] (Spring 2024) Examining key texts from critical race theory to contract law, feminist approaches to reproduction to decolonial critiques of the museum, this course develops multiple overlapping challenges to property and situates them within histories of performed and embodied art. We will study the racial, sexual, and colonial politics of performance, considering in particular questions of subjection and objecthood; repetition and deviation; ritual and documentation; and preservation and decay. Together, we will ask: Can we use performance art to explore, contest, and renegotiate property? What is property’s relationship to labor, occupation, law, and natural right, and how might performance rework those fundamental logics? What alternative methodologies and practices for the transmission and maintenance of cultural material does performance introduce in order to resist rendering expression and/or artwork into property? Students will develop a series of writing projects over the course of the semester and acquire a critical vocabulary to approach and write with performance art across culture and time.",

In that sense, performance will be investigated as a methodology anchored in the material conditions and objects from which it emerges, while also challenging reductive notions of “liveness” and “ephemerality” that have come to define it. Foregrounding Black, trans, and queer perspectives, contemporary performances will be read alongside performance studies, critical theory, visual art, art history, theater, and dance.

    "description": "The focus of this course will be the Mediterranean Sea, between the late antique and modern period (ca. 391 and 1492), in a number of its distinctive manifestations, political, religious, social, cultural, and economic. Once upon a time, the Mediterranean Sea was possessively defined as the mare nostrum (our sea), and claimed by the Roman Empire or some other superpower. As a result, the Mediterranean, since then, has been viewed almost exclusively with a Euro centricity, founded on colonialism and exploitation. Current historiography, the social sciences, has broken away from that single local, and ultimately incomplete narrative for the Mediterranean. The primary goal for this course is to provide a “wider and more humane history” that is more inclusive of “invisible people and cultures” and provides alternate narratives to the ones currently in the history books. The conception of the ‘Great Sea’ as a boundary-less space allows us to address the many lacunae in its history that are now being acknowledged.",

In particular, we will consider how the museum experience affects the attitudes and assumptions of museum visitors. We will explore the intellectual under-pinnings of the modern museum since the Enlightenment, with special attention to issues of nationalism and eurocentrism; the complexities of museum sponsorship (public, private, and corporate), and how they shape cultural presentation; and the emergence, since the 1960s, of community-oriented museums alongside the growing importance in society of multi-culturalism and ethnic identity. We will also consider standard art-historical issues of style and society as they relate to the various artworks we see.",

For the majority of the lectures, we will proceed geographically, examining artworks produced by peoples of the Southwest (Anasazi, Mimbres, Hohokam, Pueblo, Navajo, Apache), East (Archaic, Woodland, Mississippian, Chitimacha, Seminole, Miccosukee, Cherokee), West (Mandan, Cheyenne, Crow, Kiowa, Metis), Far West (Chumash, Pomo, Wiyot, Washoe), North (Beothuk, Innu, Cree, Dene, Inuit), and Northwest Coast (Proto-Salish, Makeh, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka’wakw). During our last lecture, we will look to art produced after 1900, when a pan-Indian identity began to develop, resulting in works that are not always easily categorized by specific tribal communities or geographic areas. The works that we will consider over the course of the semester span a wide spectrum of media: pottery, basketry, textiles, architecture, sculpture, painting, performance, installation, photography, etc. We will grapple with complex questions regarding whether or not all of the objects under review should be deemed “art” in the Euro-American sense of the term, which in many cases has been retroactively accorded these objects. We will also be attendant to the effects that new economies, markets, materials, technologies, and patronage have had upon the circulation of these works, as well as the production/reception of newer works.",

Yet it is best known from accounts and texts written by its enemies, including the Assyrians, Greeks, Romans and Arabs. In this class we shall explore ancient Persia on its own terms through direct engagement with the material culture produced by the people living there over a period of several millennia, from prehistory to the fall of the Sasanian Empire. In doing so we shall address such topics as identity, migration and imperialism through the study of reliefs, seals, coins, architecture, pottery and statuary. We shall also consider how ancient Greek and modern European views of Persia have affected our understanding of its art and history. This course is designed for students without prior experience in ancient art or archaeology.",

    "prereqText": "",
    "description": "In 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the invention of the World Wide Web signaled a new era of global capitalism, information exchange, and connectivity. For artists, the Internet became an ideal platform for networked computational experimentation, building on practices underway since the 1960s such as mail art, video art, cable television, and telematic and cybernetic art. Free from earlier closed government and academic networks, and exchanging the white cube for users’ desktops, artists quickly gained access to new tools, audiences, and communities. In this course, we will look closely at key works of Internet art from the 1990s to the dotcom crash in the early 2000s, including Donald Rodney’s Autoicon (1997–2000), Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace’s CyberPowWow (1997–2004), Mendi + Keith Obadike’s Black.Net.Art Actions (2001–2003), programming duo JODI’s glitched out websites (1995–1999), and cyberfeminist collective VNS Matrix’s online and irl agitprop (1991-1997). We’ll approach each work and practice as a node in the larger history of Internet art, connecting it with other works and online communities to better consider the ways that artists seized on this digital cultural shift to explore issues of personhood, identity, community, consumerism, surveillance, globalism, narrative, access, and code. We will learn about Internet art distribution, display, and preservation by examining landmark online and independent exhibitions, its uptake by conventional art institutions, and ongoing archival efforts. We’ll visit digital arts-focused local institutions and host guest artists and researchers to further our discussions. You can expect readings in media theory, postcolonial studies, posthumanism, cyberfeminism, queer theory, cultural studies, and art history, along with primary texts from early online forums and magazines. And, of course, we’ll also watch the cult 1995 film, Hackers. ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و .",

We will also explore the economy, politics, geography, and institutional framework of art shows as an integral part in the construction of meaning. Special emphasis will be placed on artists who, starting in the 1960s, have used exhibitions as their medium.",

    "description": "The recent “decolonial” and “global” turn in museums and curatorial practice often ignores the fact that art history provides the disciplinary foundation for the museum as a colonial institution. What would it mean to curate against Euro-American narratives of art history? How do you curate artists and exhibition histories that aren’t found in institutional archives? How does curatorial practice offer alternate art historical evidence? This course thinks through such questions by engaging with theories and activist practices of decolonization, postcolonial theory, Black studies and Asian studies to move towards other epistemologies and methods of curatorial practice. It will foreground minoritized artists and transnational exhibition histories across Western Europe and North America, and the global South, while considering alternate epistemologies, aesthetics and collections beyond the hold of both art history and the museum. We will study texts, artists, artifacts, art objects, embodied practices, museum collections, exhibition histories, and modes of display and their relationship to questions of history, temporality, translation, untranslatability, spectatorship, provenance, stewardship and the life of objects. 2 credits.",

    "description": "This course reevaluates the high modernist ideals of medium specificity and autonomy by animating artists’ work across media and collaborations with creatives in other disciplines, including dance, performance, theater, music, craft, design, poetry, publishing—even forays into archaeology and ecology. Throughout, we will devise alternate vocabularies and frameworks to account for the period against the restrictive conventions of formalist criticism, which dictated that visual artists focus on the formal concerns of their given medium without recourse or reference to other disciplines, especially literature and popular culture. Problematizing the modernist project’s exclusionary rhetoric of medium “purity” as vested in paradigms of gender, sexuality, race, labor, class, and nationality we will examine how intermedial projects rerouted and upended normative values. The course introduces attendant strategies such as embodiment, genre conflation, improvisation, ethical participation, and empathetic corporeality, alongside notions of alterity, disaffiliation, transmediality, subcultural codes and communication, collaborative kinship, and solidarity. Centering on artists and movements in Central, South, and North America between 1920-1960, we will chart how cross-disciplinary projects structured transnational networks through performance, publications, and exhibition-making.",
